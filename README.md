# Dungeon Scaling

This mod features a region-based difficulty and loot scaling for locations such as structures, biomes, and dimensions.

This project originated as a [backport](https://github.com/1Xevi/DungeonDifficulty-Backport) of the mod **[Dungeon Difficulty](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/DungeonDifficulty)** by [**Daedalus** (daedaulus_dev/ZsoltMolnarrr)](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr) for **Minecraft 1.20.1**. It has since diverged significantly and is now developed
and maintained as an independent project.

All credit for the original concept and initial codebase goes to the original author.
